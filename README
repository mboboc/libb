The following library is inspired by the indivitual project named LIBFT from
42. There are 4 sections:

1. **Libc Functions:** Some of the standard C functions
2. **Additional functions:**
3. **Bonus functions:** Useful for Linked list manipulation
4. **Personal Functions:** Functions I believe will be uselful later

1.
	**FT_MEMSET:** void *ft_memset(void *s, int c, size_t n);
		- fill first n bytes of the memory area pointed by s with the constant
		byte c
	**FT_BZERO:** void ft_bzero(void *s, size_t n);
		- sets the first n bytes of the area starting at s to zero (\0)
	**FT_MEMCPY:** void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t num)
		- copies n characters from source to destination
	**FT_MEMCCPY:** void *memccpy(void *s1, const void *s2, int c, size_t n);
		- copies characters from source to destination stopping after the first occurrence of c had been copied, or after n bytes have been copied
	**FT_MEMMOVE:** void *ft_memmove(void *dest, const void *src, size_t num);
		- copies n characters from source to destination
		- src and dest can overlap
	**FT_MEMCHR:** void *ft_memchr(const void *src, int value, size_t n);
		- serches whithin the first num bytes of the block of memory pointed by ptr for the first occurrence of value and returns pointer to it
	**FT_MEMCMP:** int ft_memcmp (const void *s1, const void *s2, size_t n);
		- compares first n bytes of s1 to first n bytes of s2; returns 0 if equal or the difference if not
	**FT_STRLEN:** size_t 	ft_strlen(const char *str);
		- returns length of string
	**FT_STRDUP:** char *ft_strdup(const char *str);
		- returns pointer to a null-terminated byte string, which is a dublicate of the string provided by str
		- DOESN'T free the memory 
	**FT_STRCPY:** char *ft_strcpy(char * dest, const char *src);
		- copies src in dest, including the terminating null character
	**FT_STRNCPY:** char *ft_strncpy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n)
		- copies up to n characters from src to dest
		- if length of src is less than that of n, the remainder of dest will be padded with null bytes
